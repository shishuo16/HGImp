# HGImp
an intelligent genotype imputation reference recommendation method with convolutional neural networks
## Background
Genotype imputation is a statistical method for estimating missing genotypes that are not directly assayed or sequenced in study from a denser haplotype reference panel.Existing methods usually performed well on imputing common frequency variants, but not ideal for rare variants, which typically play important roles in many complex human diseases and phenotype studies. Previous studies showed the population similarity between study and reference panel is one of the key features influencing the imputation performance.
